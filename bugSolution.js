The solution involves correctly handling the asynchronous nature of `takePictureAsync`. Ensure that any code which depends on the `uri` property only executes *after* the promise returned by `takePictureAsync` has resolved.

Here's an example using `async/await`:

```javascript
async function takePicture() {
  try {
    const photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync();
    // Correct: This line will only execute once the promise resolves
    console.log("Photo URI:", photo.uri);
    // ...further image processing using photo.uri...
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error taking picture:", error);
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use `.then()`:

```javascript
function takePicture() {
  cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync()
    .then((photo) => {
      console.log("Photo URI:", photo.uri);
      // ...further image processing using photo.uri...
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error("Error taking picture:", error);
    });
}
```
By using either `async/await` or `.then()`, you guarantee that the `uri` will be available and the code won't execute before the promise is fulfilled.
