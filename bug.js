This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and involves the `takePictureAsync` method.  The issue isn't immediately apparent as there are no clear error messages within the Expo console. The problem arises when there is an asynchronous operation taking place after calling `takePictureAsync` that attempts to access the image URI from the result of `takePictureAsync` before the promise has fully resolved. This leads to unexpected behavior where the URI is undefined or null.

```javascript
async function takePicture() {
  const photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync();
  // Incorrect:  This line might execute before photo is resolved
  console.log("Photo URI:", photo.uri);  
  // ...further processing that depends on photo.uri...
}
```
