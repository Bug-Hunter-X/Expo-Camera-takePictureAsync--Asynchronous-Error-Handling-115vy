This repository demonstrates a common asynchronous error when using Expo's Camera API. The `takePictureAsync` method returns a promise, and accessing the `uri` property before the promise resolves can lead to unexpected errors. The solution showcases proper asynchronous handling using `.then()` or `async/await` to ensure the URI is available before processing.
